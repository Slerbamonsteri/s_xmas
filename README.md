Happy holidays and tree hunting for FiveM

**Features**

* Unlimited locations

* Optional logging (You must setup it yourself, it's implemented on the server file but commented out)

* Includes default loot table and raredrop table with random chance ( supports  items, money and weapons by default )

* Player can claim each tree only once 

* Config option to limit the amount of gifts trees can hold ( default 10 gifts/claims each tree )

* Config option to enable/disable blips if you want people to hunt for these trees

* Currently uses steam name to check if player has already claimed tree, maybe change to something like xPlayer.identifier instead?  Up 2 you

* Trees reset each server restart

* Randomized drops for players, on both default and rare drop tables.

* Handles the prop spawning, all you have to do yourself is setup the locations and loot tables

* Also included some admin command snippets for clearing props / vehicles / peds. Has nothing to do with the script itself but just something I might aswell share should someone need it

* Easy to modify for your needs. Loot table structure supports multiple drops etc.
